1. What do you mean by an array?
Ans: An array in programming is a data structure storing elements of the same type sequentially. It allows accessing elements by index, providing a way to manage collections of fixed size.

2. How to Create an Array?
Ans: In Java, you create an array using square brackets [] after the data type, specifying size or initializing it with values in curly braces {}.
int[] myArray = new int[5]; // Declaration with size
int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Declaration with initialization

3. Can we change the size of an array at runtime?
Ans: In languages like Java, array sizes are fixed once created. To change size, a new array with a different size needs creation, and elements from the old array can be copied.

4. Can you declare an array without assigning the size of an array?
Ans: In Java, you can declare an array without specifying its size initially, later assigning it:

int[] myArray;
myArray = new int[5]; // Assigning size later

5. What is the default value of an array?
Ans: In Java, default values for array elements depend on the data type. For primitives like int, default is 0, and for objects, it's null.

6. What is a 1D array with an example?
Ans: A 1D array is a linear array storing elements in a single row. Example:

int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // 1D array of integers

7. Write a program on a 2D array.
Ans:

public class TwoDArrayExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] twoDArray = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}; // Example 2D array
        
        for (int i = 0; i < twoDArray.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < twoDArray[i].length; j++) {
                System.out.print(twoDArray[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
