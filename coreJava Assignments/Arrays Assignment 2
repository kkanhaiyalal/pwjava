1. What is the default value of Array for different data types?
Ans: In Java, the default values for array elements are determined by their data types. For primitives like int, the default is 0, for boolean it's false, and for objects, it's null.

2. Can you access the negative number in Array size?
Ans: In programming languages, an array's size represents the number of elements and can't be negative as it doesn't make logical sense to have a negative count of elements.

3. Where does Array stored in JVM memory?
Ans: Arrays in Java are stored in the heap memory, following the same memory allocation rules as other objects.

4. What are the disadvantages of Array?
Ans: Arrays in many programming languages have fixed sizes once created. Modifying their size involves creating a new array and copying elements, which can be inefficient. Additionally, arrays lack built-in methods for easy manipulation.

5. What is an Anonymous Array in Java? Give an example.
Ans: An anonymous array in Java is one without a specific name, created for immediate use. Example:

int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3}; // Anonymous array creation

6. What are the different ways to traverse an Array in Java?
Ans: In Java, arrays can be traversed using for loops, enhanced for loops, while loops, or even using Java 8 streams with lambda expressions.

7. What is the difference between length and length() methods? Give an Example.
Ans: In Java, length is an array attribute representing the size of the array. length() is a method used for strings to get their length. Example:

int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
System.out.println(numbers.length); // Prints the array size
String str = "Hello";
System.out.println(str.length()); // Prints the string length
