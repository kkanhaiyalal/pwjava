1. What is a String in Java?
Ans: In Java, a String is a sequence of characters. It's an object representing a fixed sequence of characters and is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed once created.

2. Types of String in Java?
Ans: In Java, there are mainly two types of strings:

Literal Strings: Created using double quotes, like "Hello".
String Objects: Created using the new keyword, like new String("Hello").

3. In how many ways can you create String objects in Java?
Ans: There are mainly three ways to create String objects in Java:

Using double quotes: String str = "Hello";
Using the new keyword: String str = new String("Hello");
Using character arrays: char[] charArray = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'}; then String str = new String(charArray);

4. What is a String constant pool?
Ans: The String constant pool is a special area in memory where String literals are stored. It's a pool of unique String objects created by the JVM to optimize memory usage.

5. What do you mean by mutable and immutable objects?
Ans: In Java, mutable objects are those whose state (data) can be changed after creation. Immutable objects, like Strings, cannot be changed once created. Any operation that appears to modify a String actually creates a new String object.

6. Where exactly is the String constant pool located in the memory?
Ans: The String constant pool is located in the non-heap (permanent generation) memory area of the JVM. It's a part of the method area where class-level data (including String literals) is stored.
