Question 1: What is the Collection framework in Java?
Answer : The Collection framework in Java is a unified architecture that provides interfaces (like List, Set, Queue) and classes (like ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet) to handle collections of objects efficiently.

Question 2: What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
Answer : ArrayList: Uses a resizable array, suitable for random access but slower for insertions/deletions in the middle.
LinkedList: Uses a doubly linked list, efficient for insertions/deletions but slower for random access.

Question 3: What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
Answer : Iterator: Basic interface for iterating through collections in one direction.
ListIterator: Subinterface of Iterator, allows bidirectional traversal and additional functionalities like adding elements during iteration.

Question 4: What is the difference between Iterator and Enumeration?
Answer : Iterator: Introduced in Java 1.2, allows safe modification of collections during iteration.
Enumeration: Legacy interface, only allows forward traversal and doesn't support collection modification.

Question 5: What is the difference between List and Set?
Answer : List: Ordered collection that permits duplicate elements.
Set: Unordered collection that does not allow duplicates.

Question 6: What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?
Answer : HashSet: Implements Set interface using a hash table, unordered with faster insertion/retrieval but doesn't maintain order.
TreeSet: Implements Set interface using a self-balancing red-black tree, ordered with slower operations but maintains elements in sorted order.

Question 7: What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Answer : Array: Fixed-size data structure holding elements of the same data type.
ArrayList: Dynamic array implementation from the Collection framework, resizable, and holds objects, providing dynamic resizing and additional methods compared to arrays.
