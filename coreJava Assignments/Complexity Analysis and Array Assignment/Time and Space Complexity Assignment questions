Question 1:
The time complexity of the provided Java code is O(n^2). To improve it, consider the purpose of the inner loop. As it stands, it doesn't perform any operations; it's an empty loop. If possible, reconsider the logic within the loops to make it more meaningful. Otherwise, removing the inner loop would significantly enhance the code's efficiency.

Question 2:
Given the recurrence relation: T(n) = 3T(n-1) + 12n with T(0) = 5.
The value of T(2) can be found as follows:
T(2) = 3T(1) + 12(2)
= 3[3T(0) + 12(1)] + 12(2)
= 3[35 + 12] + 24
= 3[15 + 12] + 24
= 327 + 24
= 81 + 24
= 105

Question 3:
The given recurrence relation is: T(n) = T(n-1) + c.
Using substitution method:
T(n) = T(n-1) + c
= [T(n-2) + c] + c
= T(n-2) + 2c
= T(n-3) + 3c
...
= T(n-k) + kc

For the base case where k = n:
T(0) = T(n - n) + nc
= T(0) + nc
= c + nc
= c(1 + n)

Question 4:
Given recurrence relation: T(n) = 16T(n/4) + n^2logn.
By the Master Theorem, this is a case of:

a = 16
b = 4
f(n) = n^2logn
Comparing f(n) to n^c, where c = log_b(a):
Here, c = log_4(16) = 2.
f(n) = n^2logn = n^(c log n).
This falls into case 3 of the Master Theorem.

Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2 log^2 n).

Question 5:
Using the Recursion Tree method for T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n:


          T(n)
         /    \
     T(n/2) + n/2
    /       \
T(n/4)+n/4  T(n/4)+n/4

In each level, the cost is n. There are log(n) levels. Therefore, the total cost is O(n log n).

Question 6:
For T(n) = 2T(n/2) + K using the Recurrence Tree method:


        T(n)
       /   \
  T(n/2)+K T(n/2)+K
    / \
 T(n/4)+K T(n/4)+K
The cost at each level is K. There are log(n) levels. Therefore, the total cost is O(K log n).
